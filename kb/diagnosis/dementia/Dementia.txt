Dementia is an umbrella term for a range of progressive conditions that affect the brain.
Each type of dementia stops a person’s brain cells (neurones) working properly in specific areas, affecting their ability to remember, think and speak.
Doctors typically use the word ‘‘dementia’’ to describe common symptoms – such as memory loss, confusion, and problems with speech and understanding – that get worse over time.
Dementia can affect a person at any age but it’s more common in people over the age of 65.
There are over 200 subtypes of dementia. The most common are Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia and mixed dementia.
By 2025, it’s estimated that over one million people in the UK will have a diagnosis of dementia – and almost all of us will know someone living with the condition. Our dementia specialist Admiral Nurses explain the facts you need to know.

Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia in the UK. It’s caused by a build-up of proteins in the brain which damage the brain cells’ ability to transmit messages.
The symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease tend to get worse over time. They include:
- difficulty remembering recent events (often retaining a good memory for past events)
- poor concentration
- difficulty recognising people or objects
- poor organisational skills
- confusion
- disorientation
- slow, muddled or repetitive speech
- difficulty performing everyday tasks such as cooking, paying bills, and shopping
- problems with decision-making
There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, but medication is available to help slow its progression.

Vascular dementia is the second most common type of dementia. It’s caused by problems in the supply of blood to the brain, commonly due to strokes or ‘mini strokes’ called transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs). This causes areas of cell damage in the brain.
Changes in a person’s condition as a result of TIAs or a larger stroke are often sudden and then plateau (level off). But the damage caused often means the person never functions quite the same as they did before.
Vascular damage can also take place in the smaller vessels of the brain (‘small vessel disease’) and symptoms may be more gradual.
The symptoms of vascular dementia are often similar to Alzheimer’s disease, such as memory problems, disorientation and difficulty with communication.
However, symptoms can depend on which area of the brain has been affected and may include specific problems with:
- language
- reading
- writing
- sudden changes in mood
- walking
- bladder control

Lewy body dementia is a progressive condition that affects movement and motor control (the ability to control voluntary movements for specific tasks, like walking, getting dressed and using cutlery). Memory is often less affected than with other types of dementia.
A person with dementia with Lewy bodies might:
- be prone to falls
- have sudden bouts of confusion
- have tremors (shaking or trembling, similar to Parkinson’s disease)
- have trouble swallowing
- experience disrupted sleep patterns due to intense dreams/nightmares
- have visual (sight) and auditory (hearing) hallucinations
- shuffle when they walk

Frontotemporal dementia affects the frontal lobes of the brain: the part that controls behaviour, learning, personality and emotions.
It can affect people of all ages, but is more common in people aged 45 to 65 years than in those aged 65 and over.
Frontotemporal dementia can be difficult to diagnose. It’s sometimes confused with depression, stress, anxiety, psychosis or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Frontotemporal dementia can cause inappropriate social behaviour and a lack of inhibitions. Eating patterns can also be affected, with people suddenly bingeing on food, especially sweet foods.

It’s possible to have two types of dementia at the same time, most commonly Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.
A person with mixed dementia will experience a mixture of the symptoms associated with the types of dementia they have.

Young onset dementia is any type of dementia where symptoms develop before the age of 65. You might hear it described as ‘early onset dementia’ or ‘working age dementia.’ It’s thought that about five percent of people with dementia have young onset dementia.
The most common types of dementia amongst younger people are Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia. Rare and genetically inherited types of dementia like Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease are also more common in younger people.
Problems with language, vision, behaviour and/or personality may be the first symptoms, rather than memory loss. This can result in a delay in diagnosis as the symptoms may be wrongly attributed to another problem such as depression, work stress or relationship difficulties.
